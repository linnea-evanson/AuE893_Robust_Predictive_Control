# AuE893: Robust Predictive Control
This repository contains class work and practice example based on Model Predictive Control 

## HW01: 
### 1] Linear, non-linear models, Laplace domain transformations, linearization and descretization of plant models, state space realization 
### 2] Time-varying linear quadratic problems, rate of change penalty 
### 3] Steady-state Riccati equation 

## [HW02](https://github.com/vipulkumbhar/AuE893_Robust_Predictive_Control/tree/main/Homework_2): 
### 1] Nominal MPC problems
### 2] Nominal MPC with Kalman filter based state estimators
